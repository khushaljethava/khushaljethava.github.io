The classmethod() method returns the class function for the given function.

The syntax of the classmethod() method is:

```python
classmethod(function)
```

The classmethod() is considered un-pythonic in newer python versions to use the @classmethod decorator for the classmethod definition.

The syntax of the classmethod decorator is:

```python
@classmethod
def func(cls, args....)
```

## What is a class method?

A class method is a function that is bound to a class rather than its objects, which does not require the creation of a class instance, more like a staticmethod.

The main difference between a staticmethod and a classmethod is:

* Static method knows nothing about the class and just deals with the parameters.  
    
* The class method works with the class since its parameters are always the class itself.

## classmethod() Parameters

classmethod() method only takes a single parameter:

function - function name that needs to be converted into a class method.

### Example 1: How to use classmethod()?

```python
class Dog:
    color = 'Black'

    def printColor(cls):
        print("The color of Dog is", cls.color)

# create printColor class method

Dog.printColor = classmethod(Dog.printColor)

Dog.printColor()
```

The output will be as follow:

```python
The color of Dog is Black

```

Here, we have a class Dog, with a member variable color assigned to black.

We also have a function printColor that takes a parameter cls and not the self we usually take.

cls method accepts the class Dog as a parameter rather than Dogâ€™s object/instance.

Now we pass the method Dog.printColor as an argument to the function classmethod. This will convert the function to a class method to accept the first parameter as a class(i.e., Dog).

In the last line, we call printColor without creating a Dog object as we do for static methods. This prints the class variable color.

## Rules of classmethod()

classmethod() function will return a class method for a given function.
