## How to make Bank Management System Project in Python

Let's start developing a bank management system project in python step by step.

## Define the required classes

You will need to create a few classes for this project, such as a Bank class, Account class, and Transaction class.

* **Bank**: contains a list of accounts and methods to add and remove accounts.  
* **Account**: contains the account number, owner name, balance, and methods to deposit, withdraw, and get the balance.  
* **Transaction**: contains the transaction amount and type (deposit or withdrawal).

### Bank class:

* Properties: name, accounts (list)  
* Methods:  
  * init(self, name): initializes the Bank object with a given name and an empty list of accounts.  
  * add\_account(self, account): adds an Account object to the accounts list.  
  * remove\_account(self, account): removes an Account object from the accounts list.

| class Bank:    def \_\_init\_\_(self, name):        self.name \= name        self.accounts \= \[\]    def add\_account(self, account):        self.accounts.append(account) |
| :---- |

### Account class:

* Properties: number, owner, balance, transactions (list)  
* Methods:  
  * init(self, number, owner, balance): initializes the Account object with a given account number, owner name, and balance.  
  * deposit(self, amount): adds the amount to the balance and appends a Transaction object to the transactions list with the type 'Deposit'.  
  * withdraw(self, amount): subtracts the amount from the balance if there are sufficient funds and appends a Transaction object to the transactions list with the type 'Withdrawal'.  
  * get\_balance(self): returns the current balance of the account.

| class Account:    def \_\_init\_\_(self, number, owner, balance):        self.number \= number        self.owner \= owner        self.balance \= balance        self.transactions \= \[\]    def deposit(self, amount):        self.balance \+= amount        self.transactions.append(Transaction(amount, 'Deposit'))    def withdraw(self, amount):        if self.balance \>= amount:            self.balance \-= amount            self.transactions.append(Transaction(amount, 'Withdrawal'))        else:            print('Insufficient funds') |
| :---- |

### Transaction class:

* Properties: amount, type  
* Methods:  
  * init(self, amount, type): initializes the Transaction object with a given amount and type.

| class Transaction:    def \_\_init\_\_(self, amount, type):        self.amount \= amount        self.type \= type |
| :---- |

## Implement the user interface

Next, you'll need to create a user interface for your Bank Management System.

Here's an outline for creating a user interface in a Bank Management System project in Python:

1. Welcome message: display a welcome message to the user and prompt them to choose an option.  
     
2. Options menu: display a menu with the following options:  
* Create account: prompts the user to enter the account number, owner name, and initial balance.  
* Deposit: prompts the user to enter the account number and deposit amount.  
* Withdraw: prompts the user to enter the account number and withdrawal amount.  
* Check balance: prompts the user to enter the account number and displays the current balance.  
* Transaction history: prompts the user to enter the account number and displays a list of transactions for the account.  
* Quit: exits the program.


3. User input: use the input() function to get the user's choice and input data.  
     
4. Data validation: use conditionals to check the validity of the user's input, such as whether the account number exists, the deposit amount is positive, or the withdrawal amount does not exceed the account balance.  
     
5. Output: use the print() function to display the results of the user's actions, such as the new account balance or the transaction history.  
     
6. Loop: use a loop to repeat the options menu until the user chooses to quit.

## Implement the logic:

Next, you'll need to create a user interface for your Bank Management System.

1. Initialize the Bank object with a name and an empty list of accounts.  
     
2. Use a loop to display the options menu and get the user's choice.  
     
3. Depending on the user's choice, perform the corresponding action using conditionals:  
   * Create account: create a new Account object with the given account number, owner name, and balance, and add it to the accounts list of the Bank object.  
       
   * Deposit: search for the Account object with the given account number and call its deposit() method with the given amount.  
       
   * Withdraw: search for the Account object with the given account number and call its withdraw() method with the given amount.  
       
   * Check balance: search for the Account object with the given account number and call its get\_balance() method to display the current balance.  
       
   * Transaction history: search for the Account object with the given account number and display the list of transactions stored in its transactions property.  
       
   * Quit: exit the program.  
       
4. Use loops and conditionals to search for Account objects with the given account number, and check their validity before performing transactions. For example, if the account number is not found, display an error message.  
     
5. Use lists to store the transaction history for each Account object, and update it whenever a deposit or withdrawal is made.

| def main():    bank\_name \= input('Enter bank name: ')    bank \= Bank(bank\_name)    print('Bank', bank\_name, 'created successfully')    while True:        print('1. Create Account')        print('2. Deposit')        print('3. Withdraw')        print('4. Exit')        choice \= int(input('Enter your choice: '))        if choice \== 1:            acc\_number \= input('Enter account number: ')            acc\_owner \= input('Enter account owner name: ')            acc\_balance \= float(input('Enter opening balance: '))            account \= Account(acc\_number, acc\_owner, acc\_balance)            bank.add\_account(account)            print('Account created successfully')        elif choice \== 2:            acc\_number \= input('Enter account number: ')            amount \= float(input('Enter amount to deposit: '))            account \= find\_account(bank.accounts, acc\_number)            if account:                account.deposit(amount)                print('Deposit successful')            else:                print('Account not found')        elif choice \== 3:            acc\_number \= input('Enter account number: ')            amount \= float(input('Enter amount to withdraw: '))            account \= find\_account(bank.accounts, acc\_number)            if account:                account.withdraw(amount)                print('Withdrawal successful')            else:                print('Account not found')        elif choice \== 4:            print('Thank you for using the Bank Management System')            break        else:            print('Invalid choice')def find\_account(accounts, number):    for account in accounts:        if account.number \== number:            return account    return Noneif \_\_name\_\_ \== '\_\_main\_\_':    main() |

## Test the system:

Now that you have the classes and user interface implemented, you can test the Bank Management System. Here's an example of how you can create an account, deposit money, and withdraw money:

Testing is an important part of software development, including for a Bank Management System project in Python. After defining the classes and implementing the logic, it is essential to test the system to ensure that it works as expected and meets the requirements.

Testing can involve a variety of methods, such as unit testing, integration testing, and acceptance testing. Unit testing involves testing individual components of the system, such as classes and methods, to ensure that they work correctly. Integration testing involves testing how different components of the system work together to ensure that they integrate properly. Acceptance testing involves testing the system as a whole to ensure that it meets the requirements and expectations of the users.

In a Bank Management System project in Python, testing can involve creating test cases for each of the system's features, such as creating an account, making a deposit, withdrawing funds, checking the balance, and viewing the transaction history. Test cases can include both valid and invalid inputs to ensure that the system handles errors and exceptions properly.
