## Using Matplotlib: Changing Font Size in Plots and Charts

Matplotlib is a popular data visualization library that provides various tools for creating high-quality plots and charts in Python. One essential aspect of data visualization is the ability to customize font size to improve readability and visual appeal. In this section, we will explore how to change font size in Matplotlib using various techniques.

### How to change font size in python Matplotlib

Let's see some examples of how we can change font size in python matplotlib

#### Changing Font Size for Entire Plot

To change the font size of all text elements in a plot, you can use the rcParams dictionary. This dictionary contains various default settings for Matplotlib and can be used to set the font size for all text elements in a plot. Here's an example:

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Set font size for all text elements in plot
plt.rcParams.update({'font.size': 12})

# Create a plot
plt.plot([1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6])

# Add labels and title
plt.xlabel('X-axis')
plt.ylabel('Y-axis')
plt.title('My Plot')

# Show plot
plt.show()
```

In this example, we set the font size to 12 using the update method of the rcParams dictionary. This changes the font size of all text elements in the plot, including the axis labels and title.

#### Changing Font Size for Specific Text Elements

Sometimes, you may want to change the font size for specific text elements in a plot, such as the axis labels or legend. Matplotlib provides several methods for achieving this.

##### a. Changing Font Size for Axis Labels

To change the font size for axis labels, you can use the set\_xlabel and set\_ylabel methods of the Axes object. Here's an example:

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Create a plot
fig, ax = plt.subplots()
ax.plot([1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6])

# Set font size for axis labels
ax.set_xlabel('X-axis', fontsize=14)
ax.set_ylabel('Y-axis', fontsize=14)

# Show plot
plt.show()
``` 

In this example, we set the font size for both axis labels to 14 using the fontsize argument of the set\_xlabel and set\_ylabel methods.

##### b. Changing Font Size for Legend

To change the font size for the legend in a plot, you can use the fontsize argument of the legend method. Here's an example:

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Create a plot with legend
fig, ax = plt.subplots()
ax.plot([1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], label='Line 1')
ax.plot([1, 2, 3], [7, 8, 9], label='Line 2')
ax.legend(fontsize=12)

# Show plot
plt.show()
```


In this example, we set the font size for the legend to 12 using the fontsize argument of the legend method.

Changing font size is an important aspect of creating readable and aesthetically pleasing plots and charts in Python. Matplotlib provides several methods for changing font size, from setting the font size for all text elements in a plot using the rcParams dictionary, to changing the font size for specific text elements such as axis labels and legends. By using these techniques, you can improve the readability and visual appeal of your Matplotlib plots and charts.

To change the font size for all text elements in a Seaborn plot, you can use the set method of the rc object. This object provides a simple interface to customize various settings for Seaborn plots, including font size. Here's an example:

```python
import seaborn as sns

# Set font size for all text elements in plot
sns.set(font_scale=1.2)

# Create a plot
tips = sns.load_dataset("tips")
sns.scatterplot(x="total_bill", y="tip", data=tips)

# Show plot
plt.show()
```


In this example, we set the font size for all text elements in the plot using the set method of the rc object. This changes the font size of all text elements in the plot, including the axis labels and legend.

#### Changing Font Size for Specific Text Elements

Sometimes, you may want to change the font size for specific text elements in a Seaborn plot, such as the axis labels or legend. Seaborn provides several functions for achieving this.

##### a. Changing Font Size for Axis Labels

To change the font size for axis labels in a Seaborn plot, you can use the set\_xlabel and set\_ylabel methods of the Axes object. Here's an example:

```python
import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt  # Ensure matplotlib is imported

# Create a plot with axis labels
tips = sns.load_dataset("tips")
ax = sns.scatterplot(x="total_bill", y="tip", data=tips)
ax.set_xlabel("Total Bill", fontsize=14)
ax.set_ylabel("Tip Amount", fontsize=14)

# Show plot
plt.show()
```


In this example, we set the font size for both axis labels to 14 using the fontsize argument of the set\_xlabel and set\_ylabel methods.

##### b. Changing Font Size for Legend

To change the font size for the legend in a Seaborn plot, you can use the fontsize argument of the legend method. Here's an example:

```python
import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt  # Ensure matplotlib is imported

# Create a plot with legend
tips = sns.load_dataset("tips")
ax = sns.scatterplot(x="total_bill", y="tip", hue="day", data=tips)
ax.legend(fontsize=12)

# Show plot
plt.show()
```


In this example, we set the font size for the legend to 12 using the fontsize argument of the legend method.

Changing font size is an important aspect of creating readable and aesthetically pleasing data visualizations in Seaborn. Seaborn provides several methods for changing font size, from setting the font scale for all text elements in a plot using the set method of the rc object, to changing the font size for specific text elements such as axis labels and legends using various functions and methods. By using these techniques, you can improve the readability and visual appeal of your Seaborn plots and create more informative data visualizations.

## Creating GUIs with Tkinter: Customizing Text Font Size and Style

Tkinter is a standard Python library for creating graphical user interfaces (GUIs). It provides a simple way to create windows, buttons, labels, and other graphical elements. One important aspect of creating GUIs is customizing the text font size and style. In this section, we will explore how to customize the font size and style in Tkinter.

### How to change font size in python tkinter 

Let's see some examples of how we can change font size in python tkinter

#### Changing Font Size

To change the font size of text in Tkinter, you can use the font parameter when creating a text widget or label. The font parameter takes a tuple of two elements: the font family and font size. Here's an example:

```python
import tkinter as tk

# Create a text widget with custom font size
root = tk.Tk()
text_widget = tk.Text(root, font=("Arial", 14))
text_widget.pack()

# Start GUI
root.mainloop()
```


In this example, we create a text widget with a font size of 14 points and the Arial font family. You can change the font size to any value that suits your needs.

<script type="text/javascript">
	atOptions = {
		'key' : '98858c4e91885e00ea9926beee01c03e',
		'format' : 'iframe',
		'height' : 90,
		'width' : 728,
		'params' : {}
	};
</script>
<script type="text/javascript" src="//www.highperformanceformat.com/98858c4e91885e00ea9926beee01c03e/invoke.js"></script>
#### Changing Font Style

To change the font style of text in Tkinter, you can use the font parameter with additional arguments to specify the font style, such as bold or italic. Here's an example:

```python
import tkinter as tk

# Create a label with custom font style
root = tk.Tk()
label = tk.Label(root, text="Hello, world!", font=("Arial", 14, "bold"))
label.pack()

# Start GUI
root.mainloop()
```


In this example, we create a label with a font size of 14 points, the Arial font family, and the bold font style. You can also use other font styles such as italic or underline.

#### Changing Default Font

To change the default font for all widgets in Tkinter, you can use the font parameter with the tkinter.font module. This module provides a way to create font objects with various properties such as font family, font size, and font style. Here's an example:

```python
import tkinter as tk
import tkinter.font as tkfont

# Create a custom font object
custom_font = tkfont.Font(family="Arial", size=14)

# Set the default font for all widgets
root = tk.Tk()
root.option_add("*Font", custom_font)

# Create a label with default font
label = tk.Label(root, text="Hello, world!")
label.pack()

# Start GUI
root.mainloop()
```

In this example, we create a custom font object with the Arial font family and a font size of 14 points. We then set the default font for all widgets using the option\_add method of the root window. Finally, we create a label with the default font.

Customizing the font size and style is an important aspect of creating GUIs in Tkinter. Tkinter provides several ways to change the font size and style, from using the font parameter when creating widgets to setting the default font for all widgets using the tkinter.font module. By using these techniques, you can create GUIs that are more readable and visually appealing to users.
